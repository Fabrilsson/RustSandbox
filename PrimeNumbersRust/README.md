# PrimeNumbersRust

This is a simple prime number detection algorithm written in Rust. Inside you will be able to find both sequential and parallel implementations, as well as a simple way of knowing which implementation is faster.

The output is both lists of prime numbers as well as a time stamp for each implementation.
